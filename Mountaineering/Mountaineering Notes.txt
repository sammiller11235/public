Knots
- Figure 8
	- Learn your knots
	- Use to tie into the rope at the ends (re-woven figure 8).
	- Use to make a quick back-up knot for a rescue prusik hitch (in-line figure 8)
	- Can't "escape" in-line knot if the rope is loaded
- Bowline or butterfly
	- Learn your fucking knots
	- Use to tie into the rope in the middle
	- These knots allows you to "escape" even if the rope is loaded
- Girth hitch
	- Use to hitch to an anchor
	- Use to hitch to a picket
	- Use to hitch to a backpack loop
- Prusik hitch
	- Learn your fucking knots!
	- Use to prusik your ass up the rope after falling into a crevasse (foot and chest prusik)
	- Use to prusik along the rope to minimize falling distance (chest prusik)
	- Use to attach hero loops: save your bro!
- Tie-off knots: Double fisherman, Water knot (webbing)
	- Use to tie stuff off
	- learn yo knots, please
- Clove hitch
	- Temporary adjustable anchor knot
	- Swap with in-line figure 8
- Munter hitch
	- Friction knot used to belay without belay device
	- Used to set up a releasable loaded fixed point (Munter-Mule-Overhand)
- Mule
	- Used to create a temporary knot, usually above a munter hitch, that can be released under load
	- Make sure to secure the loose end (with overhand or carabiner to anchor point)
	- Tend the loose end while releasing to avoid binding
	- When tying, keep collar close to top


Carabiners
- Locking vs. wiregate
	- When to use locking:
		- When you want to be "fixed" to something (fixed to the rope, fixed to an anchor)
		- Tying into the rope (e.g. butterfly)
		- Attaching to fixed anchor (e.g. using personal anchor)
	- When to use a wiregate
		- When you want to "temporarily" fix to something (e.g. running protection)
		- When you are using it as a back-up
		- When its not serving a safety function
- Opposite and Opposing
	- Redundancy and peace of mind

Belaying
- Belay device
	- Keep your brake hand on the rope!
	- Consider loading direction (for when they fall)
	- Tending the rope (don't let it catch your legs!) (or get knotted)
	- "Catch" you partner, give a little
	- If you're belaying, you better fucking be an anchor (otherwise use an anchor).
		- Sitting rather than standing
		- Kick your feet in
		- Assume they are going to fall
- Munter belay
	- Same as belay device
	- Set knot so it won't have to "flip"
	- Be conscious of release side: it should be towards the inside of the carabiner, rather than the lock
- Hip belay
	- Use when the ground is fairly flat and the consequences of a fall are mild (assess run-out). Good way to quickly protect a novice climber
- Boot belay
	- Use when the ground is steeper and the consequences of a fall are relatively minor (assess run-out)
- Belay from anchor
	- Use when the terrain is sketchy and the consequences of a fall are grave
- Loading direction: assume a fall
	- make sure you're stable and on stable ground
	- consider how the falling climbing would "swing"
	- consider how a rescue would be made assuming a fall
- Communication ("On-Belay?", "Belay On", "Climbing", "Slack", "Falling!", "Take!", "Rock!", "Ice!", "Off Belay")
	- You need to know these and use these regularly. It builds trust among a team.
- Belay Escape
	- Situation: belaying from anchor. Something happens to partner, need to get out of belay to perform rescue or get help
	- Tie belay-device-mule-overhand (pass rope through ATC beaner to keep brake direction downward. Tie mule-overhand above ATC).(main line)
	- Hero-loop prusik hitch above mule-overhand. Munter-Mule-Overhand (MMO) from prusik to anchor. (secondary line)
	- MMO from loose brake side to anchor (main line)
	- 1st release mule-overhand from ATC (you've "escaped"). 2nd release secondary MMO (secondary line). 3rd release final MMO (main line).

Rappel
	- TIE KNOTS IN ROPE ENDS!
	- PA into anchor
	- Setup ATC to midpoint in PA, 2 loops if possible (for extended rappel with auto-block)
	- Rope to anchored carabiner at rope midpoint. Both lengths of rope through ATC
	- Setup auto-block -> tightly wrapped cord around rope. Locking carabiner through both ends and through harness belay loop
	- Test rappel setup. Double check locking carabiners. Note: you are on your own here, likely noone is checking your work and noone is backing you up
	- PA to belay loop, creating redundancy in ATC if 2 loops.
	- Rappel, mending auto-block
	- Alternative non-extended rappel: ATC to belay loop and auto-block carabiner to harness leg.

- Tying a Texas Prusik: http://www.cascadeadventures.net/images/climb_school/texas_prusik.pdf
- Runners, prusiks and hero loops:
	Three 5ft runner (made of tubular nylon webbing (9/16" or 1" thick))
	Two 9ft runner (made of tubular nylon webbing (1")) 
	Chest Prusik (5 mm or 6 mm perlon cord) (Same length as your height e.g. 6ft tall, 6ft rope)
	Leg Prusik (5 mm or 6 mm perlon cord) (Height:Rope length, 5ft:11ft, 5.5ft: 11.5ft, 6ft:12ft, 6.5ft:13ft)
	Two Hero loop (4 ft long each (5mm or 6mm perlon cord))
	Chest harness (8 ft long - same material as runner)

Techniques
- Assessing runout
	- Rocks?
	- Crevasse?
	- Cliffs?
- Self arrest
	- Self arrest grip (on ice axe)
	- Feet-up (don't want crampons to catch in the snow)
	- Drive your axe point into the snow
	- Don't give up, even slowing yourself slightly will help the team arrest you
- Crampons
	- Essential for ice, useful for snow
	- Consider snow pack and run-out. Wear if snow is hard or run-out is ugly.
	- Don't use if snow is balling up underfoot
	- Put them on BEFORE you need them
	- Don't fucking glissade in crampons!
- Ascending
	- Balance: keep your fucking balance. Move from a position of balance to a new position of balance
	- 3 point stability (not a line). Use your ice axe and 2 feet to keep your fucking balance
	- rest step: methodical pace. Rest on your bones, not on your muscles (knee and hip lock-out, heel down)
	- step kicking: use the weight of your leg as a pendulum, rather than muscles. Minimum size is a platform for ball of your feet
	- direct vs. diagonal
- Descending (Plunge step, face down, glissade, direct vs. diagonal)
- Arresting (self arrest, self belay, face-first, headback, assessing snow)
- Roped Protection (team arrest, running belay, passing pro(tection), rope etiquette)

Decision Making
- Can everyone be expected to self-arrest? If not -> rope the fuck up
- Can the rope team arrest all falls w/ team arrest only? If not -> place protection (e.g. picket)
- Is a given obstacle (e.g. crevasse) going to have large implications (e.g. dangerous/hard to arrest)? If yes -> running belay
- Can pro be used to protect all falls? If not -> turn the fuck around.?
- Turn around or proceed with risks? -> You REALLY trying to die out here bro?

Basic Rope Techniques
 - Tie-in:
	- End climbers: Re-woven figure 8 knot. Chest prusik above foot prusik
	- Mid-rope climbers: Butterfly knot with 1-locking and 1-nonlocking carabiner at harness hardpoint, opposite and opposed. 
		Chest prusik on up-hill strand. Foot prusik on downhill strand. Note: you'll need to move one or the
		other prusik in the case of self-prusiking out of a crevasse.
	- Chest prusik to carabiner at harness hardpoint
	- Foot prusik in pocket or to carabiner on side of harness
	- Kiwi-coil w/ butterfly: Rope coil to minimize excess rope length, e.g. when going from glacier to rocks, or short-roping
		- After Figure-8 at rope-end:
		- Tightly coil excess rope from hip to opposite shoulder (usually on dominant hand hip)
		- Tie off coil with overhand and non-locking carabiner (if needed)
		- Butterfly knot with 1-locking carabiner on main line (or bowline)
		- Traditional kiwi: after coil, take bight through hardpoint, up and under coil, overhand to main line, cinch and biner to hardpoint
	- Chest harness to keep you upright after falling into crevasse. Most people consider these optional
	- Girth hitch to backpack w/ carabiner
 - Climbing:
	- In general, look to minimize exposure:
		- Avoid climbing under areas with obvious rock-fall or ice-fall
		- End-run crevasses rather than jump
		- Be wary of snow-bridges, especially in afternoon or soft snow conditions
		- Follow established routes but recognize the mountain changes everyday
	- Minimize slack in the rope. Consider the climbers above and below (slope, obstacles, fitness) and speak up if needed
	- It can be difficult to minimize slack in the rope when doing switchbacks. Communicate and work to minimize overall slack.
	- Don't step on the rope with your fucking crampons. If rope is on the ground near you, look before you step.
	- Reel-in climbers when the team has reached a safe resting point (make a neat coil)
	- Feed-out line when starting to minimize knots (unravel 1 coil at a time)
	- Flake out rope before use
	- When taking off backpack on steep slope, use girth hitch to ice axe or similar so you don't lose it
 - Schedule:
	- Set a turn-around time and stick to it
	- If you are well-prepared and know your gear and knots, it takes about 1 hr to wake, dress, eat, piss, and tie-into rope
		- If you aren't well-prepared it may take you longer. Consider your group, don't make everyone wait, especially if it's cold
	- Don't over-dress when you start. You will generate a lot of heat. Have rain jacket and puffy accessible though.
		- Wear gloves before your hands get cold. Your body will be pushing blood to your legs and core, it can hard to warm up cold hands and feet.
	- Generally aim to summit early morning and be off glaciers by noon
	- Scope out the route ahead of time. Knowledge of features, altitude of features, ridges to follow, etc.
	- If you expect route-finding may be an issue (no bootpack, 1st time on route, etc.), give extra time and continually evaulate
	- When climbing ~20-30 degree slope, Aim for 1 hr per 1000 ft.
		- Add time for poor visibility, lack of route knowledge, lousy snow or needing to kick steps
		- Add time for fatigue or poor fitness
		- Subtract time for straightforward route, good route beta, solid snow, and good weather
	- Don't take super long breaks. Keep it to about 10 minutes every 1 or 1.5 hours. 
		- Moderate pace w/ short breaks > fast pace w/ long breaks
	- Remember down-climbing is always the most risky time: Keep your focus!
		- Worsening snow conditions
			- Weakening snow bridges
			- Difficult to self-arrest in mushy snow
			- More likely that snow pushes out from underneath feet
			- Watch out for snow balling up under crampons
		- Fatigue
		- Heat stroke or sun fatigue
		- Less focus because you reached the summit
		- Big heavy plungesteps can cause snow bridges to collapse or avalanches to initiate
 - Weather:
	- Watch the skies! Forecasts are always approximate
	- Increasing pressure signifies improving conditions
	- Drop in pressure signifies worsening conditions
	- An increase in your (barometric) altimeter signifies a drop in pressure. E.g., waking up the morning of a summit climb and 
		finding that your barometric altimeter has you 200 feet closer to the summit than when you went to sleep is a sign 
		that the pressure dropped during the night (potentially bad weather incoming)
	- Cloudy but dry weather in the lowlands may translate to wet weather in the mountains (dew-point).
	- Cumulus clouds may signify incoming wet weather or thunderstorms (big fluffy clouds with well-defined edges)
	- High-altitude leniticular clouds (UFO looking) combined with increasing windspeed almost always means weather is incoming
	- High, wispy clouds, known as cirrus, and low shelf-like clouds, known as stratus, are less of a concern. 
		Stratus clouds can produce light precipitation, but they won’t produce lightning.
	- Thin clouds sitting at summit suggest it will be windy and potentially nasty up there. Some weather likely in next 24 hrs.
	- Questionable weather does not always deteriorate. Sometimes you will complete the non-technical, 
		early sections of a climb in poor weather with the hopes that the weather will improve. Granted,
		shitty conditions at low altitude usually mean worse conditions at higher altitude.
 - Avalanche:
	- Read the reports. Don't risk it.
	- ~30 degree, sun-faces slopes are the most dangerous
	- Look for previous avalaches, loose-slides, pin-wheels
	- If you see avalanches occur, you should probably turn back
	- Often avalanche conditions are worst in the afternoon of warm days
	- Consider wind-loading
	- Gullys tend to funnel avalanches
	- Climb on windward side of ridges
	- Best to avoid avalache conditions in all circumstances

- Stepping Techniques
	- Start in a position of balance, end in a position of balance
	- Keep ice axe out in front of you. 2 hands on axe in very steep terrain. 
	- Consider 1-handed self-arrest grip (moderate slope), 2-handed belay grip (steeper slope, direct climbing), 
		2-handed self-arrest grip (very steep slope, especially when side-stepping or hybrid techniques)
	- 2 points of contact w/ snow at all times (feet or axe)
	- Only move axe when your lower leg is firmly planted
	- "Rest-step" : Step up quickly, then lock your downhill knee and shift your weight back onto that leg.
	- Rest on your bones, not on your muscles! 
	- Focus on deep methodical breathing.
	- Pressure breathing at high altitude : purse your lips and force air out slowly (increased pressure in lungs)
	- Don't over-pump your muscles. You will fatigue quickly. Find your equilbrium pace. Try not to sprint and stop.
	- If you feel a pump (calves, quads, glutes especially), slow you pace and focus on breathing
	- Don't forcefully kick steps into the snow, let the momentum of your step and the weight of your leg do the work.
	- "French technique" : Keep your crampons flat on the snow or ice, engage all of the bottom points, 
		versus kicking straight into the ice with your front points. Much less tiring and more stable than front-pointing.
	-  "Duck Foot" : roll your ankles outward to keep all crampon points in contact with the snow. Stand up straight 
	- "Side-stepping" : One foot over another, axe up-hill and in-front. A step w/ each foot and then move axe. Keep all
		Crampon points into ice. May need to point toes slightly downhill on steepest slopes on hard ice.
	- "Hybrid Technique" : Continuous front-pointing on low-angle ice is a huge strain on the calves and feet. 
		It’s often far better to front-point with one crampon and flat-foot with the other. Alternate feet. 
	- "Front pointing" : Use on steep, hard ice. Technical ice-climbing crampons are designed for this (big straight front points). 
		The more you lean into the mountain, the less effective you crampons will be (shear vs compression strength of ice)
