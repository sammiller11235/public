Altitude Sickness
-----------------
In response to reduced oxygen content in the air at altitude, our bodies increase respiratory rate, pulse rate, 
and blood pressure in an attempt to maintain a sufficient supply of oxygen to our organs including increased 
cerebral blood flow in and attempt to oxygenate the brain. The increased respiratory rate alters the pH of 
our blood and when our kidney's ability to re-balance this are exceeded, the permeability of our tissues increases. 
The resulting system-wide "leaks" present as visible swelling in the hands and feet, high altitude cerebral 
edema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). With the development of severe AMS, death can occur within six hours.

Mild AMS Sickness
-------------
- Headache (feels like a hangover)
- Abnormally increased respirations and shortness of breath during normal exercise.
- Insomia
- Decreased appetite that is often accompanied by nausea.
- Swelling of hands, feet, and occasionally face.
Mild AMS Treatment
------------------
- Stop ascent and rest until kidneys catch up, pH balance is restored, and symptoms disappear
- If symptoms worsen, descend until symptoms resolve.
- Administer NSAIDS to reduce headache during rest days.
- Acetazolamide to speed acclimatization.
- Increase fluids and electrolytes to maintain hydration status; monitor urine output and color.
- Diet high in carbohydrates; avoid proteins and fats.

Moderate AMS Sickness
---------------------
- Severe and increasingly debilitating headache (migraine)
- Abnormally increased respirations and shortness of breath during mild exercise.
- Episodes of vomiting are possible.
- Awake and irritable or lethargic with increasing fatigue.
- Rales or crackling sounds in the lungs.
Moderate AMS Treatment
----------------------
- Stop ascent and descend until symptons disappear. Patient may or may not be able to self-evac. Drug therapy is not a substitute for descent.
- Decrease and limit exercise.
- Use supplemental oxygen (1 L/min @ rest) if available.
- Use a portable hyperbaric chamber to stabilize patient prior to descent or if descent is not immediately possible.
- Acetazolamide (Rx) by mouth 250 mg twice a day during descent.
- Dexamethasone (Rx) 4 mg four times a day by mouth or IM during descent untilsymptons subside (usually within 12-24 hours).
- Nifedipine, Sildenafil Citrate or Tadalafil for HAPE if crackling sounds are present in lungs.
- Salmeterol to reduce pulmonary edema if crackling sounds are present in lungs.
- Increase fluids and electrolytes; monitor urine output and color.
- Administer NSAIDs to reduce headache during rest days.

Severe AMS Sickness (HACE & HAPE)
---------------------------------
- Onset is variable; however, death may occur within 6 hours of developing signs and symptoms.
- Severe and increasingly debilitating headache (migraine).
- Abnormally increased respirations and shortness of breath at rest.
- Persistent vomiting and decreased coordination (ataxia). Evaluate: have patient walk in a heel-to-toe straight line; if their balance wavers â€” failed.
- Awake and extremely lethargic/exhausted progressing to voice responsive, pain responsive, and unresponsive.
- Rales or minor crackling sounds in the lungs progressing to a productive cough and/or gurgling.
Severe AMS Treatment
--------------------
- Stop ascent and descend until symptoms disappear. Carry or litter evac is required.
- Use supplemental O2 (1 L/min at rest) if available.
- Use a portable hyperbaric chamber prior to descent or if descent is not immediately possible.
- Acetazolamide (Rx) 250 mg twice a day by mouth during descent.
- Dexamethasone (Rx) 4 mg four times a day for HACE by mouth or IM during descent until symptoms subside.
- Nifedipine (Rx) for HAPE 20 mg sublingual immediately and follow with 30 mg slow-release four times a day during descent until symptoms subside.
- Support HAPE patients in sitting or semi-reclined position to help facilitate their breathing.
- Positive pressure ventilations may be helpful but difficult during an evacuation.
